## Downloading the firmware to the ESP32 Module

Info for the flash files and initial image download for the ZX-Wespi project:

ZX-Wespi is usually able to do over-the-air (OTA) updates via the webserver user interface. 

However, for the following cases a regular download of the flash image is required:

- When initially setting up a brand new ESP32 for your Zeddy
- If something went really wrong during OTA
- If you want to reuse an ESP32 that was used in a different project

This short instruction is for using the ESP32 download tool (tested with V3.8.5)


- Connect ESP32 to computer via USB or COM as applicable

- Get the download tool, at time of writing available at  <https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools>, choose flash_download_tool_v3.8.5 or higher
- Run the tool, go to "Developer Mode", "ESP32", choose "SPI download" tab
- Set up the following files and positions to flash:

  partition-table.bin     @  0x8000 
  ota_data_initial.bin    @  0xd000
  bootloader.bin          @  0x1000
  zx_iot.bin		  @ 0x10000

- For the rest of parameters, use:

  SPI SPEED 40MHz
  SPI MODE DIO
  FLSH SIZE 32MBit  (=4MB)
  COM: (need to find out, look up in your OS' device manager in case of doubt)
  BAUD: 460800 (may pick a different baud rate)


- Press start to flash. If the ESP32 does not connect automatically, try holding the BOOT knob and/or EN(reset)
